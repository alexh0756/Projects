# Predicting Popular Music

The aim of this project was to develop a machine learning model to categorise popular songs based on music data. The project was divided into 2 parts, with the first being primarily data exploration and the second being model fitting. After cleaning and feature selecting on the data, a grid search was used with each potential machine learning algorithm. Random Forest was demonstrated the best success from all the algorithms and it was selected as the final model.
